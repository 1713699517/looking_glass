== Introduction

Looking Glass is a tracer and profiler for Erlang/OTP.

Looking Glass is the next generation profiling tool. It
is implemented as an `erl_tracer` NIF and thus requires
Erlang/OTP 19.0 or above.

Looking Glass aims to provide a very efficient tool
usable both in development and production settings,
and capable of running for a very long amount of time
even on busy systems.

=== Supported platforms

Looking Glass is currently developed on Linux but should
also work on OSX and Windows.

Looking Glass requires Erlang/OTP 19.0 or above.

A cachegrind tool is required for reading the output
from `lg_callgrind`. The `qcachegrind` tool (also
known as `kcachegrind`) is recommended. Note that
it is a good idea to also install `graphviz` to
have the quite informative call graphs.
